# Image-to-ASCII-Art Converter

## About the Program
This is a simple image-to-ASCII art converter tool written in Python. It uses the `pywhatkit` module to convert images into ASCII text. This project is ideal for Python beginners to explore basic image processing and file handling concepts.

## How to Use This Tool
1. **Setup**: Open the `Image-to-ASCII-Art-Converter` folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode).
2. **Prepare Input**: Move your input image into the `input_img` folder and give it a suitable name (e.g., `demo.jpg`).
3. **Run the Program**: Run the `main.py` file. When prompted, enter the name of the image file (e.g., `demo.jpg`) and press Enter.
4. **View Output**: After the program runs successfully, the ASCII art will be saved in the `output_file` folder as a `.txt` file.
5. **Example**: You can refer to `demo-ascii-art.txt`, which contains the ASCII art generated from the sample input image.
